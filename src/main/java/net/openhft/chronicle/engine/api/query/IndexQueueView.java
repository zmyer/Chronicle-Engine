/**
 * Based on a filter, Provides a snapshot ( some times referred to as an image ) of all the
 * latest values and then subsequent updates. The snapshot can be considered to work much like
 * a map does, where the latest values are returned based on the keys. You can specify the index
 * from where you want the data, so you will initially get the snapshot and then all subsequent
 * changes.  Even if the server is restarted, The snapshot is Guaranteed to provide at least all
 * the data for the current roll cycle , the snapshot will always contain only the fields that are
 * known not to then subsequently change up to the current end of the queue. If the server has not
 * been restarted then be snapshot is built up using the changes since the start of the cycle in
 * which it  was started. If the server is restarted and you ask for an index that before the
 * current roll cycle, the response then becomes the same as a filtered response from a queue. If
 * you on the other hand as for an index that's mid current cycle you will get a snapshot that is
 * made up of all the fields that are know not to subsequently change until the current end of the
 * queue. Then followed by all the changes from that point ( like a queue does), this way  once
 * you have read the queue to the end, your data model will always be fully updated for all your
 * keys, regardless of where in the current roll cycle you decide to replay the data from. If you
 * specify the index of 0 then the data will be replayed from the end of the queue and the
 * snapshot will contain all the latest values for all the keys. So In summary : The
 * IndexQueueView is ideal if all your entries change each roll cycle,  IndexQueueView is not able
 * to give you a snapshot where the entries have not changed since the last roll cycle, such as
 * yesterday.
